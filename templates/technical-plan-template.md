## Technical Approach

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Components**: New components to be created
- **Pages**: New or modified pages
- **State Management**: State changes required
- **API Integration**: Frontend API client updates
- **Styling**: CSS/styling approach
- **Routing**: Any routing changes

### Backend (Django)
- **Models**: New or modified database models
- **APIs**: New or modified endpoints
- **Authentication**: Auth requirements
- **Business Logic**: Core logic implementation
- **Data Migration**: Migration strategy if needed

### Database Design

#### New Tables
```sql
-- SQL schema for new tables
```

#### Modified Tables
```sql
-- SQL for table modifications
```

#### Data Migration Strategy
- Migration steps
- Data integrity considerations
- Rollback procedures

## API Design

### New Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request | Response |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| GET    | /api/... | Description | {...}   | {...}    |
| POST   | /api/... | Description | {...}   | {...}    |

### Modified Endpoints
- List any changes to existing endpoints
- Backward compatibility considerations

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: How users are authenticated for this feature
- **Authorization**: What permissions are required
- **Data Protection**: How sensitive data is protected
- **Input Validation**: Validation strategy
- **Output Sanitization**: Sanitization approach

## Performance Implications

- **Database Performance**: Query optimization considerations
- **API Performance**: Expected response times
- **Frontend Performance**: Rendering and user experience
- **Caching Strategy**: What can be cached and how

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Backend: Models, views, serializers
- Frontend: Components, hooks, utilities

### Integration Tests  
- API endpoint testing
- Database interaction testing

### End-to-End Tests
- User workflow testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Risk 1 | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | Mitigation strategy |
| Risk 2 | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | Mitigation strategy |
