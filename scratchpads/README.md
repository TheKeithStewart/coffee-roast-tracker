# Scratchpads Directory

This directory contains working documents created during the development workflow process.

## File Naming Convention

- `{issue-number}-technical-plan.md` - Technical plans created by System Architect
- `{issue-number}-designs.md` - Design documents created by UX Designer  
- `{issue-number}-implementation-log.md` - Implementation notes and progress
- `{issue-number}-review-feedback.md` - Review feedback from various personas

## File Lifecycle

1. **Created** during workflow execution by respective personas
2. **Updated** through iteration cycles based on feedback
3. **Finalized** when all stakeholders approve
4. **Referenced** during implementation and future maintenance
5. **Archived** after feature completion (moved to subdirectory)

## Access Pattern

- Each file is owned by the persona that created it
- Other personas can read and comment but not directly modify
- Updates happen through the review and feedback process
- Final approval comes from designated reviewers

## Retention Policy

- Active issues: Keep in main directory
- Completed issues: Move to `archived/{year}/{quarter}/` subdirectories
- Reference documents: Maintain for 1 year after completion
