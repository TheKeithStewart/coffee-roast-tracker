   - Create all interaction states with CSS hover effects, focus indicators, and JavaScript event handling
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

2. Create comprehensive design specifications:
   - Document exact measurements, spacing, typography, and color specifications
   - Define component behavior and interaction patterns with detailed annotations
   - Specify micro-animations and transition timing with easing and duration details
   - Create asset inventory with all required icons, images, and graphics
   - Prepare developer handoff documentation with implementation guidance

# INTERACTIVE WEB PROTOTYPING
1. The `ui-ux-prototyping-specialist` will create functional web-based prototypes:
   - Build fully working HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototypes with realistic user interactions
   - Implement form validation, data handling, and dynamic content updates using JavaScript
   - Create CSS animations and transitions for micro-interactions and smooth user experience
   - Design responsive prototype behavior with actual breakpoint functionality across devices
   - Include accessibility interaction patterns with proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support

2. Web prototype features to implement:
   - Complete functional user workflows with working forms, buttons, and navigation
   - JavaScript form validation with real-time feedback and error state handling
   - Multi-page navigation or single-page app routing with smooth transitions
   - Loading states with CSS animations and JavaScript progress indicators
   - Error handling with JavaScript error catching and user-friendly error displays

# DESIGN REVIEW
1. Use the `staff-ux-designer` subagent for comprehensive design review:
   - Evaluate design quality and user experience effectiveness
   - Verify design system consistency and brand compliance
   - Assess accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Review responsive design implementation across all breakpoints
   - Validate interaction patterns and user workflow optimization

2. Review criteria to cover:
   - Visual design quality with attention to hierarchy, contrast, and readability
   - User experience effectiveness with task completion efficiency and error prevention
   - Design system integration with consistent component usage and styling patterns
   - Technical feasibility with realistic implementation constraints and performance considerations
   - Accessibility compliance with comprehensive inclusive design validation
